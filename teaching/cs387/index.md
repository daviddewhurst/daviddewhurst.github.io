+ [**Syllabus**](./syllabus.pdf): please read it. It's not great if you ask me a question and the answer is on the syllabus.
+ **Reading list**: I am nowhere near organized enough to know when in the semester we will read these papers, but I'm pretty sure that we will read them
    at some point. This list is not guaranteed to be in *any order*.
