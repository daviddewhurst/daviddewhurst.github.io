#### Description

+ [Husband](./photos/wife.jpg) and [father](./photos/kids-weird.jpg)
+ Senior scientist at [Charles River Analytics](https://cra.com/)
+ Former lead data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/) and graduate fellow at [MITRE](https://compfi.org/).

#### Interests

I develop probabilistic AI for military and financial applications, focusing on non-kinetic grey-zone conflict. This includes

+ Financial resilience
+ Information operations
+ Cybersecurity

to which I often apply the tools of

+ Probabilistic programming
+ Stochastic optimization
+ Nonparametric and Bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling

#### Open-source software
+ [`lppl`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/lppl/): the last probabilistic programming language (lppl) I will ever write, hosted in C++, probably never finished
    + [`lppl-examples`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/lppl/examples/): using lppl for various inference tasks.
+ [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/) Structural time series, round 3. Restriction and refinement
of `stsb2` grammar and extension of modeling capabilities, deeply integrated with Pyro and pytorch.
    + [`sts-zoo`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/sts-zoo/): a collection of wild animals created by combining [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/) blocks
