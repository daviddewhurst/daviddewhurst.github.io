#### Description

+ [Husband](./photos/wife.jpg) and [father](./photos/small.jpg)
+ Scientist at [Charles River Analytics](https://cra.com/)
+ Former lead data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/) and graduate fellow at [MITRE](https://compfi.org/).

#### Interests

I develop probabilistic AI for military and financial applications. I'm interested in

+ Financial resilience
+ Logistics and supply networks
+ Cybersecurity

to which I often apply the tools of

+ Probabilistic programming
+ Stochastic optimization
+ Nonparametric and Bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling

#### Software
+ [`libcpolymorphic`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/libcpolymorphic): a universal probabilistic programming language hosted in C; distinguished by (a) enabling open-world sample-based inference without tracing (b) zero heap usage; very much pre-alpha and a work in progress
+ [`libpolymorphic`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/libpolymorphic): a universal record-based probabilistic programming language,
hosted in C++.
+ [`CrimsonSkyline.jl`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/CrimsonSkyline.jl):
a universal trace-based probabilistic programming language, hosted in Julia.
+ [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/) Structural time series, round 3. Restriction and refinement
of `stsb2` grammar and extension of modeling capabilities, deeply integrated with Pyro and pytorch.
+ [`stsb2`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb2/)
 Structural time series, round 2. Implements a grammar over structural time series models and an 
associated modeling + inference library. 
+ [`verdantcurve`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/verdantcurve):
 agent-based market model created in collaboration with
 [Colin Van Oort](https://gitlab.com/omega1563) (MITRE Corporation).
+ [`discrete-shocklet-transform`](https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/discrete-shocklet-transform):
qualitative, shape-based, timescale-independent time series similarity search algorithm
