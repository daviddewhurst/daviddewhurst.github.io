#### Research interests

I develop probabilistic AI for military and financial applications. My major research foci are

+ Nonparametric and Bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling
+ Mechanistic models of non-equilibrium systems
+ Probabilistic programming

Application areas in which I'm interested include

+ Logistics and supply chain
+ Cybersecurity
+ Geopolitical risk
+ Enterprise risk management

#### Description

+ [Husband](./photos/kiss.jpg) and [father](./photos/small.jpg)
+ Machine learning and probabilistic modeling scientist at [Charles River Analytics](https://cra.com/)
+ Former lead data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/), graduate fellow at [MITRE](https://compfi.org/), and [trombonist](http://www.frankwitheyscholarshipfund.org/?page_id=10)

#### Software

+ [`CrimsonSkyline.jl`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/CrimsonSkyline.jl):
a universal trace-based probabilistic programming language, hosted in Julia.
+ [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/) Structural time series, round 3. Restriction and refinement
of `stsb2` grammar and extension of modeling capabilities, deeply integrated with Pyro and pytorch.
+ [`stsb2`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb2/)
 Structural time series, round 2. Implements a grammar over structural time series models and an 
associated modeling + inference library. 
+ [`verdantcurve`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/verdantcurve):
 agent-based market model created in collaboration with
 [Colin Van Oort](https://gitlab.com/omega1563) (MITRE Corporation).
+ [`discrete-shocklet-transform`](https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/discrete-shocklet-transform):
qualitative, shape-based, timescale-independent time series similarity search algorithm
