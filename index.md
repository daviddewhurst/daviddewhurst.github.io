## Description

+ [Husband](./photos/wife.jpg) and [father](./photos/all-three-kids-ellie-little.jpg)
+ Founder and president of [D R Dewhurst](https://drdewhurst.com), a strategic advisory firm.
+ Former senior scientist at [Charles River Analytics](https://cra.com/), lead data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/) and graduate fellow at [MITRE](https://compfi.org/).

## Interests

I develop probabilistic AI for military and financial applications, focusing on non-kinetic grey-zone conflict and risk quantification. Examples of these topics include

+ Financial resilience
+ Information operations
+ Various aspects of cybersecurity

to which I often apply the tools of

+ Probabilistic programming
+ Stochastic optimization
+ Nonparametric and Bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling


## Open-source software

+ [`lppl`](./lppl/): the last probabilistic programming language (lppl) I will ever write, hosted in C++, probably never finished
    + [`glppl`](./glppl/): translation of probabilistic programs into probability distributions over directed graphical models
    + [`ccyan`](./ccyan/): compilation target of `glppl`'s graphical model program synthesis functionality.
    + [`lppl-examples`](./lppl/examples/): using lppl for various modeling and inference tasks.
+ [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/) Structural time series, round 3. Restriction and refinement
of `stsb2` grammar and extension of modeling capabilities, deeply integrated with Pyro and pytorch.
    + [`sts-zoo`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/sts-zoo/): a collection of wild animals created by combining [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/) blocks
+ [`hop9`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/hop9/): HTN planning with state variables -- similar to [`pyhop`](https://github.com/oubiwann/pyhop/blob/master/pyhop/hop.py) but in C++.
+ [`sf_wrap`](https://gitlab.com/drdewhurst/sf_wrap): lifting arbitrary python code to probabilistic programs. Open-sourced from work done at Charles River Analytics.
