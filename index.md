#### Research interests

+ Nonparametric and bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling
+ Mechanistic models of non-equilibrium systems

#### Personal statistics

Husband. PhD candidate at [uvm](http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). 
Former [trombonist](http://www.frankwitheyscholarshipfund.org/?page_id=10), for what it is worth.

Here is a photo of me. It is five years old but I have not changed much.

#### Blog

From time to time I will write about things. I will list the things here.

+ [Continuum rich-get-richer dynamics and survival theory](./blog/2020-01rgr/): 
on the non-obvious connection between
the kernel function of a rich-get-richer process and the hazard function of a random variable.


#### Software

+ [`verdantcurve`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/verdantcurve):
 agent-based market model created in collaboration with
 [Colin Van Oort](https://gitlab.com/omega1563). This package contains
	+ A heterogeneous and extensible set of algorithmic trading agents
	+ A matching engine that implements a [frequent batch auction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42920973.pdf?casa_token=WQYwiAbhMW4AAAAA:6aPoP4fUReKATbS2faIbwiw8d0--C_c4CU1wCnwb9QtEHk4IabYUzcwJeHVs6M6UMYtwSrEdnTi8JAY-rZPfjTNbMHA0lFlbowmF3_JJ85vdPbRhDg), a new type of auction mechanism that greatly reduces the effectiveness of high-frequency trading strategies
	+ A orderbook and multiple types of orders
	+ A market construct to facilitate interaction between agents and the matching engine
+ [`discrete-shocklet-transform`](https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/discrete-shocklet-transform):
qualitative, shape-based, timescale-independent time series similarity search algorithm
