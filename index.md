#### Research interests

+ Nonparametric and Bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling
+ Mechanistic models of non-equilibrium systems
+ Probabilistic programming

#### Personal statistics

+ Husband
+ Father
+ Machine learning and probabilistic modeling scientist at [Charles River Analytics](https://cra.com/) and 
research fellow at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/)
+ Former lead data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/) 
and [trombonist](http://www.frankwitheyscholarshipfund.org/?page_id=10)

#### Blog

From time to time I will write about things. I will list the things here.

+ [Keep using plate notation](./blog/2020-07-28keep-using-plate-notation.html) Someone was wrong on the internet.
In particular, someone expressed their (questionable) beliefs about plate notation.
These are my feelings about that.
+ [Theoretical data science background I: functional optimization](./blog/2020-05-30theoretical-ds-background-1-functional-optimization.html) First post in a (maybe) multipost series of theoretical background for data scince.
 Here lie Euler-Lagrange equations, the general supervised learning problem, and time series smoothing.
+ [Perturbing correlation matrices](./blog/2020-04-22correlation-perturbation.html): on what we can do when we are 
presented with a correlation matrix and *not* with the data that generated it
+ [Continuum rich-get-richer dynamics and survival theory](./blog/2020-01rgr/): 
on the non-obvious connection between
the kernel function of a rich-get-richer process and the hazard function of a random variable.


#### Software

+ [`verdantcurve`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/verdantcurve):
 agent-based market model created in collaboration with
 [Colin Van Oort](https://gitlab.com/omega1563). This package contains
	+ A heterogeneous and extensible set of algorithmic trading agents
	+ A matching engine that implements a [frequent batch auction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42920973.pdf?casa_token=WQYwiAbhMW4AAAAA:6aPoP4fUReKATbS2faIbwiw8d0--C_c4CU1wCnwb9QtEHk4IabYUzcwJeHVs6M6UMYtwSrEdnTi8JAY-rZPfjTNbMHA0lFlbowmF3_JJ85vdPbRhDg), a new type of auction mechanism that greatly reduces the effectiveness of high-frequency trading strategies
	+ A orderbook and multiple types of orders
	+ A market construct to facilitate interaction between agents and the matching engine
+ [`discrete-shocklet-transform`](https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/discrete-shocklet-transform):
qualitative, shape-based, timescale-independent time series similarity search algorithm
