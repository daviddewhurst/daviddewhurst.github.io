#### Research interests

+ Nonparametric and Bayesian structural time series
+ Agent-based modeling
+ Mechanistic models of non-equilibrium systems
+ Probabilistic programming

#### Description

+ [Husband](./photos/kiss.jpg) and [father](./photos/small.jpg)
+ Machine learning and probabilistic modeling scientist at [Charles River Analytics](https://cra.com/) and 
research fellow at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/)
+ Former lead data scientist at [MassMutual](https://datascience.massmutual.com/) 
and [trombonist](http://www.frankwitheyscholarshipfund.org/?page_id=10)

#### Software

+ [`stsb3`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb3/)
 Structureall time series, round 3. Implements a (slightly different from `stsb2`) grammar over structure time series models, an associated modeling 
 library, and deep integration with the [`pyro`](http://pyro.ai) PPL.
+ [`stsb2`](https://davidrushingdewhurst.com/stsb2/)
 Structural time series, round 2. Implements a grammar over structural time series models and an 
associated modeling + inference library. 
+ [`verdantcurve`](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/verdantcurve):
 agent-based market model created in collaboration with
 [Colin Van Oort](https://gitlab.com/omega1563). This package contains
	+ A heterogeneous and extensible set of algorithmic trading agents
	+ A matching engine that implements a [frequent batch auction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42920973.pdf?casa_token=WQYwiAbhMW4AAAAA:6aPoP4fUReKATbS2faIbwiw8d0--C_c4CU1wCnwb9QtEHk4IabYUzcwJeHVs6M6UMYtwSrEdnTi8JAY-rZPfjTNbMHA0lFlbowmF3_JJ85vdPbRhDg), a new type of auction mechanism that greatly reduces the effectiveness of high-frequency trading strategies
	+ A orderbook and multiple types of orders
	+ A market construct to facilitate interaction between agents and the matching engine
+ [`discrete-shocklet-transform`](https://gitlab.com/compstorylab/discrete-shocklet-transform):
qualitative, shape-based, timescale-independent time series similarity search algorithm
