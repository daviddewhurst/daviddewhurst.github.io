There are a few principles that I try to use to guide what I do. 
Sometimes I fail and do not follow these principles.
Maybe "principles" isn't even the right word -- maybe I should call these aphorisms,
or admonitions, or maybe just words that help me do what I think is the right thing. 

Yes, an odd subject, maybe, but useful to put on record.


1. *Remember, that could be you (or: it could always get worse)* As I write this, 
I am in a fairly advantaged position -- healthy
family, interesting work, and adequate income. There is no law of the universe stating that this
state of affairs will remain. 
2. *Children are an unadulterated good.* Children do not choose to be born.
And you were a child once. It is never, ever a bad thing to have children, to take care of them
and help them through their trials and hardships, as someone did, or should have done, with you.
3. *That person was a baby once.* This is a synthesis of (1) and (2). No matter what they are
doing right now, today, that person *was* a baby.
They cried, and wanted their mother and father, and smiled and laughed and played.
Whatever state they are in today, they were born good.
4. *Time is short.* As I write this (at the age of 29), my life
is probably at least 30% complete, if not closer to 40%, and (tautologically) every day
I have less time available to me to make my parents and my children proud.
What will I do -- today, tomorrow, next year -- to show them that their work is worthwhile?
