#### Personal

My family and I live on the south coast of Massachusetts. 
It's a wonderful area that's less commonly-trafficked than the cape, at least by outsiders, and has a culture that I think is 
significantly different from much of the rest of the state. My house was built in 1920, old enough for the walls to be constructed from 
2x3s, not 2x4s.

This is the view from my backyard at two different times of year -- October on the left, January on the right.
