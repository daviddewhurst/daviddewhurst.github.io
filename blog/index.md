From time to time I will write about things. I will list the things here.

+ [Keep using plate notation](./2020-07-28keep-using-plate-notation.html) Someone was wrong on the internet.
In particular, someone expressed their (questionable) beliefs about plate notation.
These are my feelings about that.
+ [Theoretical data science background I: functional optimization](./2020-05-30theoretical-ds-background-1-functional-optimization.html) First post in a (maybe) multipost series of theoretical background for data scince.
 Here lie Euler-Lagrange equations, the general supervised learning problem, and time series smoothing.
+ [Perturbing correlation matrices](./2020-04-22correlation-perturbation.html): on what we can do when we are 
presented with a correlation matrix and *not* with the data that generated it
+ [Continuum rich-get-richer dynamics and survival theory](./2020-01rgr/): 
on the non-obvious connection between
the kernel function of a rich-get-richer process and the hazard function of a random variable.
