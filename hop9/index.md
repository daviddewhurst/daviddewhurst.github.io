# `hop9`

`hop9` is a hierarchical task network (HTN) planner written in C++. It's heavily inspired by Dana Nau's [`pyhop`](https://github.com/oubiwann/pyhop/blob/master/pyhop/hop.py) but is, you know, written in C++ and also separates concerns between state, agent(s), and parameters. It does not have any dependencies aside from a C++20 compiler and a standard library implementation.
