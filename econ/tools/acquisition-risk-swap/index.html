<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >Swaps are financial instrument that enable two or more parties to exchange value flows at pre-defined times
or upon the occurrence of precisely defined events. Subordinated risk swaps are a generic class of swaps that
trade a firm&#8217;s idiosyncratic risk (e.g., managerial or event risk) for a series of cash flows. We introduce an
acquisition risk swap, a type of subordinated risk swap designed to enable the acquiring agent (&#8220;acquirer&#8221;) to
hedge the risk of being unable to acquire a capability at an uncertain time in the future. In the case
of defense acquisition, which is the motivating driver of this work, an example of such a risk
is that associated with the widely reported shortage of 155mm shells used in modern artillery
pieces<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-1001f1"></a> .
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   We argue that adoption of ARS by users of a capability might be desirable for at least three interrelated
reasons &#8211; risk reduction, efficiency, and transparency:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
     <!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Risk reduction </span>&#8211; the purchaser of the ARS will be able to plan for future contingencies with
     increased certainty and will likely pay a lower cost for doing so if the event against which the
     purchaser is hedging does come to pass.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">
     <!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Efficiency </span>&#8211; ARS enable each party involved &#8211; the purchaser of the ARS, seller of the ARS, and
     a downstream creator of the capability that may be desired in the future &#8211; to specialize, focusing
     on their comparative advantages (of using the capability, determining the probability that the
     capability is necessary, and creating the capability respectively) rather than the party that needs
     to use the capability performing all three tasks likely suboptimally.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">
     <!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Transparency </span>&#8211; as with any type of market, the publication (to a more or less limited audience)
     of the prices resulting from exchange in that market are a signal of the extent to which the asset
     traded in that market is demanded and can be supplied. In the case of an ARS, this translates to
     transparency in the probability of (a) the time window over which a specified event might occur
     and (b) the value that the acquirer places on the acquired capability. Analysis of the ways in
     which the capability can be used in a particular context, in conjunction with the inferred value
     the acquirer places on the capability, reveals aspects of the acquirer&#8217;s strategy in that context.
     Depending on the context, this may or may not be a desirable feature of an ARS market. For
     example, prices in an ARS market could be used to signal to a nation&#8217;s adversaries, or to a firm&#8217;s
     competitors, an intent to take specific actions at a future time.</li></ul>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >In Section <a 
href="#x1-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Sec:asset-pricing --></a> we outline the basic contract structure of an ARS and derive explicit formulae for pricing it under
multiple assumptions, some of which we then relax. Section <a 
href="#x1-30003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:market-structure-overview --></a> describes possible market structures that could
facilitate pricing and exchange of ARS, while Section <a 
href="#x1-40004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:simulation --></a> describes empirical distributions of ARS prices under
multiple different modeling assumptions. We close by describing possible generalizations of our work in
Section <a

<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   How might the price of an ARS be discovered? As with other swaps, this would likely depend on the
liquidity of the underlying capability that the acquirer is hedging and the relative market power of the
acquirer(s) compared with the writer(s). In the monopsonistic case, and when the capability is relatively
liquid or even standardized, it would seem likely that the acquirer would run an English reverse auction (or
similar commonly practiced single reverse auction). When the capability is less liquid the contracted price
could be negotiated over-the-counter between the writer(s) and acquirer. We explore other mechanisms for
price discovery in Section <a

participating in the marketplace, the market clears more than half of the time. (Under this model, a
market with only one potential writer and 10 manufacturers clears almost half of the time &#8211; 44% &#8211;
while an ARS market with a healthy five writers and 20 manufacturers clears a full 92% of the

<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >We constructed a pricing and market structure framework for acquisition risk swaps (ARS), a type of
subordinated risk swap that eliminate the risk that an agent faces from needing to acquire a costly capability
during an unknown future time interval. However, we made multiple simplifying assumptions that, in our
judgement, would be eliminated in a commercial implementation of an ARS marketplace. We outline
several unaddressed shortcomings of the present work each of which could be ground for further
research.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">
     <!--l. 212--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Event probability distribution  </span>&#8211;  probably  the  most  glaring  assumption  we  made  for  each  of
     our simulations was that of events starting and stopping according to independent Bernoulli
     trials. The pricing formulae described earlier do not depend on such an assumption. In reality,
     the probability of events for which an ARS would be appropriate to hedge, such as conflict
     or  large-scale  business  transformation,  would  have  rich  structure  conditioned  on  complex
     representations of world state (e.g., geopolitical factors or the competitive structure of a firm&#8217;s
     target marketplace). Event times might also exhibit nontrivial correlation structure (e.g., if a
     conflict starts sooner than expected it could also end sooner than expected). Such dependence
     could be modeled using an appropriate copula structure.

     <li class="itemize">
     <!--l. 217--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Valuation of the capability </span>&#8211; we have assumed that the acquirer can place a monetary value on
     the capability it seeks to acquire and that the writer can assess what that monetary value is. In
     practice each of these statements may not be true. A lower bound to the value of an additional unit
     of a capability could be the sum of the marginal costs of each of its components (including labor
     and properly amortized operational expenditures) but this bound may be very weak. Estimating
     the acquirer&#8217;s value function would probably be a nontrivial task for both the writer and the
     acquirer, but could be facilitated by advances in reinforcement learning <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xschaul2015universal">SHGS15</a>]</span>. The acquirer
     may face the risk that it systematically understates its true valuation of the capability (e.g., by
     valuing it at only the sum of its marginal costs of production plus a constant value that does not
     incorporate the discounted benefits of future use) and consequently faces lower market supply
     than expected.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

class="cmti-10">Interest rate dynamics  </span>&#8211; interest rates may co-vary substantially with the probability of the
     conditioning event. For example, interest rates and the capability to be acquired may both be
     affected by geopolitical dynamics.

     <!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">Market structure </span>&#8211; we have outlined one market structure, in addition to the naive one defined
     by the mechanics of the ARS contract, that could create additional market efficiencies in terms
     of hedging risk and decoupling firms&#8217; comparative advantages. However, there are likely other
     market structures, depending on operational context, that could incentivize participation by
     different  firm  types  (e.g.,  different  production  capacities,  risk  preferences,  or  investing  time
     horizons). In some applications, markets could need to place constraints on writers and creators
     (e.g., based on capitalization or security requirements).

class="cmti-10">Price discovery </span>&#8211; the nature of the acquired capability would likely dictate the method by which
     its price is discovered. Non-exquisite, low-marginal cost capabilities (e.g., commodity drone parts)
     could be created by many parties, leading to very liquid markets; other capabilities (e.g., bespoke
     defense manufacturing) might exhibit complexity such that the market for capability creators,
     at time of the ARS&#8217;s inception, is much less liquid. The price signal created by the ARS could
     facilitate capital investment in that market if the timescale on which the ARS writers&#8217; market
     expects the capability to be needed, <span
